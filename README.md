# SQL Data Warehouse Project
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, to streamline data storage, improve data accessibility, and enable advanced analytics for business decision-making.

## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to design and implement a modern SQL data warehouse that centralizes data from diverse sources, automates ETL processes, ensures high data quality and optimized performance, and provides a robust platform for advanced analytics and informed business decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Data Integration & ETL:** Automated processes for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from multiple sources into a centralized warehouse.
- **Data Modeling:** Star and snowflake schema designs to optimize query performance and support analytical workloads.
- **Data Analytics:** Implementation of analytical queries, reports, and dashboards to derive actionable insights from large datasets.
- **Scalability & Performance:** Techniques for indexing, partitioning, and optimizing queries to ensure scalability and efficient data retrieval.
- **Data Quality & Governance:** Mechanisms for data validation, cleansing, and maintaining data integrity throughout the ETL pipeline.
- 
## TOOLS Used
- SQL Server (Database Engine, Integration Services)
- SQL (T-SQL for queries and procedures)
- Data visualization tools (Power BI)

## Project Structure

1. **Data Sources:** Collection of raw data from two Source system (ERP AND CRM) provided as a CSV file
2. **ETL Pipeline:** Scripts and workflows to process and load data into Bronze, silver and gold layers.
3. **Data Warehouse:** Fact and dimension tables designed using best practices.
4. **Analytics & Reporting:** Sample queries, reports, and dashboards for data analysis.

5. ## Business Value

By centralizing data and enabling efficient analytics, this warehouse project supports informed decision-making, historical data analysis, and business intelligence initiatives.
